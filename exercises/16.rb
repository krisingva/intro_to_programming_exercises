=begin
Take the following array a and turn it into a new array that consists
of strings containing one word. 
(ex. ["white snow", etc...] â†’ ["white", "snow", etc...]. 
Look into using Array's map and flatten methods, as well as String's 
split method.
=end

a = ['white snow', 'winter wonderland', 'melting ice',
     'slippery sidewalk', 'salted roads', 'white trees']
     
new_array = a.map { |n| n.split }
new_array.flatten!
p new_array
